Green Box
=========

Green Box is an example self-experimentation app for food, weight, and wellness.
Each participant gets their own Google Spreadsheet to hold their data and a mobile app to track and reflect on that data.

Installing Dependencies for Green Box
-------------------------------------

*  First install NodeJS
*  Next install the Ionic Framework:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Running Green Box
-----------------

After you've installed NodeJS and Ionic, then from within the `webapp` directory, run:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

This should open a web browser directly to the app.
