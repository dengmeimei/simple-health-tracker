First Visualization Plan
========================

Input Data
----------

The input data will look like the example file in `webapp/www/example/data-for-graph.json`. 

Measures
--------

The desired output measures are weight, wellness, percentage of meals with greens, percentage of meals with meat. One measure per day max. Some days will contain missing data.

Data Cleaning
-------------

* For weight and wellness, if there are multiple values per day, take the average.
* For meals, for each day, calculate the percentage of meals with green and meat
* After the cleaning step, the data should like a list of these objects:
    
   { date: string, weight: float, wellness: float, percentGreen: float, percentMeat: float }

Graph
-----

The first cut graph should show all these values juxtaposed against each other. Since we're working with a phone, a vertical graph might be interesting to try out, even though timeseries graphs are typically horizontal. But use your best instincts.

This graph should be written in Javascript (put the code in a function in a new JS file in `webapp/www/js` directory.  And this Javascript will build out the graph in the HTML inside the `webap/www/templates/tab-reflect.html` file.
